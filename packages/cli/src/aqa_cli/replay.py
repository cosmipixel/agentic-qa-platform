"""`aqa replay` (API.md §7; ADR-0024's #238 and #239 amendments): replay
each spec's committed compiled script in strict mode, with no model and no
heal, say how each run ended in one line, and exit with the runs' outcome
rolled up (`replay_result.rolled_up`).

Every spec is admitted before any run (`common.admitted_runs`): it resolves;
its compiled script, `<spec root>/.compiled/<spec id>.json`, read as explore
reads it, with no link on the way (`publication`), exists and loads, and replay
admits it (`admission.admitted`), each a spec error (exit 5), or 15 for a file
that can't be read; and its test secrets bind (12). Then each runs in argument
order (`aqa_runner.strict_replay`), on one driver (`common.replayed_runs`).

Every line printed goes through `aqa_cli.common.rendered`, scanned with
every test secret the invocation bound, and each run's record scans what
it writes with the same secrets. `--json`'s array is checked with them and
printed as it is, or as `[]` when it spells one."""
